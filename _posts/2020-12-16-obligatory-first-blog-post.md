Welcome to my personal blog!
I intend for this to be a space to share anecdotes and informative posts about who I am and what I do.
But before I do that, I think it's fitting to provide some context on why I'm doing it.

As I get further into my career as a software engineer, I find the standard one-page personal website to be less efficient at conveying to people what I do in my day-to-day life.
Behind the slick website design, it feels like a glorified resume or CV, and most of the information on it can already be found on external websites:
if I want to share my coding experience with someone, I just send them my GitHub profile;
if someone wants to know my employment history, they can find it on LinkedIn;
even if I want to use my website to inject some personality or humor, I can do that more easily on a social media site like Twitter.

I want my personal website to _enhance_ the content people could find on these other websites, rather than just trying to mirror it.
After seeing several of my peers find success using a personal blog for this purpose, I figured it was my time to give it a go.
Here are some things I hope to accomplish with this blog.

# Providing a narrative for my code

If I share a personal coding project with someone &mdash; be it a [repository](https://github.com/pangeo-data/pangeo-datastore-flask/), a [pull request](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-browser/pull/57), or even a [single file](https://github.com/pangeo-data/pangeo/blob/master/.github/workflows/preview.yml) &mdash; they would only be able to see its commit history, along with some vague comments or messages relating to this.
What they would be missing out on is the context surrounding it: the hours spent making design decisions, the early mistakes that needed to be corrected, the problems that it aimed to solve.

Worse yet are the countless projects which, due to uncontrollable factors, may eventually become impossible to share with the world.
It could be something as simple as code stored in a private location, or something more complicated like a deprecated package or functionality that unfortunately could not be archived.
In any case, I don't think anyone should have to accept the fact that some random factors of life have led to their hard work going unrecorded.

With this blog, I hope to revisit some of my favorite projects over the past few years to give them the spotlight I think they deserve, while also documenting my current projects so that I'll never have to worry that one day they will fade from memory.

# Finding an intersection between the personal and the professional

I find that now, more than ever, there is a push to merge aspects one's personal life with their professional experience.
As of December 2020, we are still deep into quarantine because of COVID-19; as a result, I have had a window into the lives of nearly all my coworkers through Zoom calls, read dozens of think pieces instructing how to balance mental health and work responsibilities, and spoken with plenty of friends on how things simply _need_ to change in the workplace to be more accommodating to employee's personal situations.

This is something I can completely get behind, and yet I still find it awkward to talk about my personal problems and interests within the context of work.
Though I recently made an account on Twitter so I could better connect with people from my job, I still haven't tweeted yet, as I can't really think of anything to share that would feel personal but also relevant to my primarily work-related followers.
Even now, I keep my Instagram account private, as a place where I can continue to interact with friends from college in a way that feels distinct from how I would with "work friends."

All of this is to say that I feel unsatisfied with how I currently balance sharing my personal and professional life.
With this blog, I hope to carve out some space to talk about how my professional life impacts the personal, and vice versa.
This could manifest in posts about mental health and thoughts on how it is handled in my workplace, or in impromptu music reviews and rants about video games I've been playing.
In either case, I think it motions towards a better understanding of how I want to navigate my work-life boundaries.

# Keeping a record of my life

As I get older, I've found myself forgetting memories from my late adolescence and early teenage years.
While I'm not necessarily kicking myself for not starting a blog back then, I realize that journaling plays a big role in retaining memories in the long term.
While I don't intend to use this blog as a daily journal, I think recording my thoughts and experiences every so often will play a big role in how I remember my twenties and onward.

With that parting thought, I think I've adequately listed my motivations to start blogging &mdash; to whoever's reading this, enjoy my posts!
And if these points resonate with you, maybe consider starting a blog of your own!
