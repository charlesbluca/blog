I am a software engineer at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, working on the [Pangeo project](https://pangeo.io).
My work explores the intersection between climate science and cloud computing, and emphasizes contribution to open-source code.

Currently, I am focused on the creation, maintenance, and cataloging of large climate data collections in cloud storage, such as the [Coupled Model Intercomparison Project](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip).
This has allowed me to work with a variety of packages in the scientific Python ecosystem, several cloud computing services across different providers, and even a handful of continuous integration pipelines.

I maintain this blog to serve as an active portfolio of my work, life, and general interests.
For a more general overview, you can also check my [resume](/CharlesBlackmonLuca.pdf).
